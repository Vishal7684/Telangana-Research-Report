Follow this directions: 
Suppose, let's say we are in 2019. (A/c to data)

Projected visitors for 2025 formula:
Projected visitors = Current visitors x (1 + Annual Growth Rate)^(Number of Years)

The formula for growth rate:
Annual Growth Rate = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years)] - 1
Here Ending values corresponds to 2019 domestic visitors and the beginning value corresponds to 2016 visitors.


For Hyderabad, in 2019, the number of domestic visitors are 1.38 cr.
If you want, you can take the covid situation into consideration and reduce the growth to 3-4%



the number of years in the investment period 2016-19 means
 2016-17 as 1 year 
 2017-18 as 1 year
and 2018-19 as 1 year.
So the number of years = 3
