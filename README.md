It was Challeged project by Code Basics.

I had learned so many new things like Running complex SQL Queries, Performing Secondry Research, Critical thinking, Video Presentation. and Making Effective Visuals that could convey my message.

Approach: Firstly, I tool datasets that was provided by codebasics then I had merged them and loaded into mysql Then I've exported each query into seprate table then I've loaded all tables in powerbi for visual purpose. In the end created Report in Google Slide.
